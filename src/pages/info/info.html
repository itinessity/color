  <div class="title">What is colorblindness?</div>
  <div class="text">
    Colorblindness is a condition where someone has trouble seeing colors correctly. Most often, people with this condition can't tell the difference between certain colors, like red and green, or blue and yellow. It's usually something you're born with because of genetics, and it affects more males than females.<br>
    While most colorblindness is inherited, some people can acquire it later in life. This can happen due to accidents, illnesses, or exposure to certain chemicals. Conditions like glaucoma, macular degeneration, or even side effects from some medications can lead to color vision problems. In these cases, the change in color vision can sometimes be managed by treating the underlying cause.
