    <h1>What is colour blindness?</h1>
    Color blindness (colour vision deficiency, or CVD) affects approximately 1 in 12 men (8%) and 1 in 200 women. In the UK there are approximately 3 million colour blind people (about 4.5% of the entire population), most of whom are male. <br>Worldwide, there are estimated to be about 300 million people with colour blindness, almost the same number of people as the entire population of the USA!
<br> <br>
    There are different causes of colour blindness. For most colour blind people their condition is genetic, usually inherited from their mother, although some people become colour blind as a result of other diseases such as diabetes and multiple sclerosis or it can be acquired due to ageing or from taking drugs and medications.
    <br> <br>
    The most common type of color vision deficiency makes it hard to tell the difference between red and green. Another type makes blue and yellow look the same. In rare cases, people have complete color vision deficiency, which means they don’t see color at all.
    <br> <br>
    The retina of our eyes have two types of light-sensitive nerve cells called rods and cones. They are found in the retina which is the layer at the back of your eye which processes images. Rod cells work in low light conditions to help night vision, but cone cells work in daylight and are responsible for colour discrimination. <br>
    <br>
    There are three types of cone cells and each type has a different sensitivity to light wavelengths. One type of cone cell perceives blue light, another perceives green light and the third perceives red light. When we look at an object, light enters our eyes and stimulates the cone cells. Our brain then interprets the signals from the cones cells so that we can see the colour of the object. The red, green and blue cone cells send electrical signals to our brain which then interprets the electrical information allowing us to see the whole spectrum of colours. For example, when the red and blue cones are simulated we will see the colour purple. <br>
    <br>
    The exact physical causes of colour blindness are still being researched, but colour blindness is usually caused by changes to the genetic code sequencing which result in  ‘faulty’ electrical signals being sent to the brain. <br>
    <br>
    People with normal colour vision have all three types of cone cells/electrical pathways working correctly, but colour blindness occurs when one or more of the cone cell types have abnormal sequencing. For example, if the red cone is ‘faulty’ you won’t be able to see colours containing red accurately. Most people with colour blindness can’t distinguish certain shades of red and green and colours which contain red and green. In people with severe forms of red, green or blue CVD one set of cone cell types does not exist at all.

    <h2>Red-green color vision deficiency</h2>
    The most common type of color vision deficiency makes it hard to tell the difference between red and green.
    <br> <br>
    There are 4 types of red-green color vision deficiency:
    <br>
    • Deuteranomaly is the most common type of red-green color vision deficiency. It makes certain shades of green look more red. This type is mild and doesn’t usually get in the way of normal activities.<br>
    • Protanomaly makes certain shades of red look more green and less bright. This type is mild and usually doesn’t get in the way of normal activities.<br>
    • Protanopia and deuteranopia both make someone unable to tell the difference between red and green at all.

    <h2>Blue-yellow color vision deficiency</h2>
    This less-common type of color vision deficiency makes it hard to tell the difference between several different color combinations.
    <br> <br>
    There are 2 types of blue-yellow color vision deficiency:
    <br>
    • Tritanomaly makes it hard to tell the difference between blue and green and between yellow and red.<br>
    • Tritanopia makes someone unable to tell the difference between blue and green, purple and red, and yellow and pink. It also makes colors look less bright.

    <h2> Complete color vision deficiency</h2>
    If you have complete color vision deficiency, you can’t see colors at all. This is also called monochromacy or achromatopsia, and it’s rare. Depending on the type, you may also have trouble seeing clearly, and you may be more sensitive to light.

    <h1>What can I expect if I have color blindness?</h1>
    During the most common type of test, your eye doctor will show you a circle made of many different colored dots. The circle has a shape inside it that’s also made of dots — like a number, a letter, or a squiggly line. This shape is easy to see if you don’t have color vision deficiency, but people with color vision deficiency have a hard time seeing it.<br>
    <br>
    There’s no cure for color vision deficiency that’s passed down in families (inherited), but most people adjust to it. Children with color vision deficiency may need help with some classroom activities, and adults with color vision deficiency may need accommodations to do jobs that rely on telling the difference between colors, like being a graphic designer.<br>
    <br>
    If your color vision deficiency is happening because of another health problem, your doctor will treat the condition that’s causing the problem. If you’re taking a medicine that causes color vision deficiency, your doctor may adjust how much you take or suggest you switch to a different medicine.<br>
    <br>
    Colour blind people face many difficulties in everyday life which normally sighted people just aren’t aware of. Problems can arise in even the simplest of activities including choosing and preparing food, gardening, sport, driving a car and selecting which clothes to wear. Colour blind people can also find themselves in trouble because they haven’t properly understood information in the workplace or not noticed themselves/their child getting sunburnt.<br>
    <br>
    Colour blindness can affect access to education, exam grades, career choice and career progression.<br>

    In business, despite it being to their own detriment, the majority of organisations don’t take account of whether all of their target audience can read or understand most of the information which they produce. Amazingly, hardly any businesses have yet to realise that they may be missing out on about 5% of their target markets because they are not aware of the effects of colour blindness. Businesses should also take account of the needs of their colour blind employees.<br>
    <br>
    Electrical goods which have red/green/orange LED displays to indicate either that a battery needs charging or the machine is on standby can be very frustrating because all these colours can appear to be orange. An example might be a handheld games console with an indicator light which changes from red to green depending upon whether the unit is fully charged or needs recharging. Wifi and TV hubs/routers can be extremely annoying because coloured lights can be difficult to interpret.

    <h1>Acquired Colour Vision Defects</h1>

    In addition to becoming colour blind by inheriting it, you can also become colour blind for other reasons. Some of the ways you can acquire colour vision loss are due to: <br><br>

    • Chronic illnesses which can lead to colour blindness include Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes mellitus, glaucoma, leukaemia, liver disease, chronic alcoholism, macular degeneration, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, sickle cell anaemia and retinitis pigmentosa. <br>

    • Accidents or strokes that damage the retina or affect particular areas of the brain/eye can lead to colour blindness.<br>

    • Medications such as antibiotics, barbiturates, anti-tuberculosis drugs, high blood pressure medications and several medications to treat nervous disorders may cause colour blindness.<br>

    • Industrial or environmental chemicals such as carbon monoxide, carbon disulphide and some containing lead can also cause colour blindness.<br>

    • Age – in people over 60 years physical changes can occur are likely to affect a person’s ability to perceive colours and research shows colour vision declines more rapidly after age 70.<br><br>

    Most people who acquire colour vision deficiency retain some ability to perceive all colours and to them the world begins to appear similar to the way it appears to vision of someone with anomolous trichromacy.<br>
    <br>
    Unlike inherited colour blindness, acquired colour blindness can vary over time. Symptoms may be mild and remain stable or they can be severe and progress to more serious forms of colour blindness, such as monochromatism, very quickly. Often the cause of colour blindness determines how severe the symptoms will be.
